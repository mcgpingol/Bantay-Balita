,0,"The Court of Appeals (CA) has finally granted Nobel Peace Prize winner Maria Ressa’s appeal to travel abroad, deeming her in-person attendance in a series of lectures in Harvard Kennedy School in Boston, Massachusetts as “necessary and urgent.” “The previous denial of Ressa’s similar Motions is inconsequential to this present Urgent Motion to Travel Abroad. Nevertheless, it is important to emphasize that the previous Motions were denied because Ressa failed to prove the necessity and urgency of her supposed travels,” the latest resolution from CA read after it denied Ressa’s previous motions last year. In August 2020, the appellate court denied her request to attend events in the United States such as the conferment of an award from the National Press Club and panel discussions on a documentary where she was featured. In December 2020, the CA junked her appeal to visit her ailing mother. The decision said ""the medical abstract lacks any indication that Ressa is urgently needed in the USA."" Aside from attending lectures, the Rappler CEO also indicated in her latest motion that she intends to visit her parents in Florida, which the CA found as a humanitarian reason to grant her motion. “Certainly, one’s legitimate intention to be reunited with her/his parents cannot be doubted,” the CA said. Moreover, the CA also noted that Ressa was able to prove that she is not a flight risk. “While Ressa’s conviction charges her situation and warrants the exercise of greater caution in allowing her to leave the Philippines, her undisputed compliance with the conditions imposed by the court a quo on her previous travels shows that she is not a flight risk,” the resolution read.In granting her motion, the CA said that travel period must only be from Oct. 31 to Dec. 2 and only for the purposes Ressa mentioned. It added that Ressa shall deposit a travel cash bond amounting to ?500,000. Furthermore, the CA also requests Ressa to submit an updated itinerary, including her travel to Florida, and she shall advice the court in writing of her return to the country."
,0,"For incumbent Vice President Leni Robredo, who is vying for the presidency in the 2022 elections, drug testing for presidential aspirants should be random and unannounced so that authentic results could be obtained. Robredo, who expressed readiness to undergo a drug test, said it would be self-serving for a candidate to submit to a drug test on a date and time preferable to the aspirant. (For me, I can do that anytime, but I think a drug test should be random, unannounced. Unannounced because we know that it is better so the real situation would be acquired.). (So it seems self-serving if I would submit myself for a drug test. But anytime somebody asks me or requests that I undergo drug testing, I would go anytime.) Drug testing among presidential aspirants appeared to have become imperative following President Rodrigo Duterte’s allegations that a presidential bet in the upcoming elections is into cocaine. First to undergo drug tests were Senator Panfilo Lacson and Senate President Vicente Sotto III, who are running for president and vice president, respectively.  The tandem went to the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA) to have the test, which found both to be negative for any illegal substance."
